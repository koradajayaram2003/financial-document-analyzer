Financial Document Analyzer – Debug Fix & Production Upgrade
📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered Financial Document Analyzer built using CrewAI and FastAPI.

The original codebase contained architectural, dependency, and import-related issues.
This version includes all debug fixes and production-level improvements.

🐛 Bugs Identified & Fixes
1. Missing tools.py

Issue: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.tools'

Fix: Recreated tools.py inside the app package and corrected imports.

2. Incorrect Import Structure

Issue: Package imports failed when running directly.

Fix: Used python -m app.main and proper package-based imports.

3. Missing Dependencies

Issue: fastapi and python-multipart were not installed.

Fix: Added required dependencies to requirements.txt.

4. Server Not Starting

Issue: Running python app/main.py did not start the server.

Fix: Used uvicorn app.main:app --reload.
